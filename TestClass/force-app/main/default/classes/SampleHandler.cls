/**
 * @description This class is a sample trigger handler for use while testing
 * the metadataTriggerHandler. Because custom metadata cannot be inserted, and
 * because the MetadataTriggerHandler instantiates handler classes from custom
 * metadata records, even when we stub/mock the metadata record retrieval we
 * still need an actuall class that it can instantiate.
 *
 * Note, this class is annotated with @isTest to prevent it's use outside of
 * tests, not because it contains tests.
